# AGENTS.md

Operational knowledge for future agent sessions working on this project and automating the user's Gmail filters and labels. Gleaned from live sessions (2026-08); verify details that may have drifted before relying on them.

**Privacy rule: this repo is public.** Never put the account address, filter counts, label names/IDs, or any content from `filters.js` into committed files (docs, tests, commit messages included). Account-specific details belong in **AGENTS.local.md** — gitignored, at the repo root of the main checkout; like `filters.js`, it does not appear in worktrees.

## Communication

- Report outcomes tersely: what was found, what was done — "1 instance: AGENTS.md. Removed and amended." Skip process narration and thoroughness reassurances; verify silently and state conclusions.
- Keep caveats and side observations to one line each.

## Project

- `email-filter-builder` generates email filters from `filters.js` (gitignored, personal, lives at the repo root of the main checkout).
- `node bin.js filters.js` writes `out/*.sieve` (ProtonMail, 50k-char chunks) and `out/gmail.xml` (Gmail import file).
- Mapping rules are documented in README.md. Key invariants: conditions sharing the same actions are OR-merged into `hasTheWord` queries chunked at 600 chars (`maxQueryLength` option); `archive` → shouldArchive; `trash` → shouldTrash; one label per Gmail filter (multi-label entries expand); sieve globs become Gmail token search terms — dangling fragments ≤3 chars are dropped, longer ones kept.
- Before importing after renderer changes, audit the generated queries against the real filters.js. A glob-translation bug once collapsed a `*@foo*.com`-style pattern to `from:(com)` — a trash filter that would have matched nearly all mail. Never let a `from` term reduce to a bare TLD; tests cover the known shapes.

## Gmail account

- Target account and current filter/label specifics: see **AGENTS.local.md**. Verify the account in the browser tab title before acting.
- Gmail caps filters at 1,000 per account; check the current count before large imports.
- Gmail applies **all** matching filters — no first-match ordering like ProtonMail sieve. Overlapping rules stack their actions (trash + label both apply; trashed mail is hidden from label views).
- A Gmail MCP server is connected (list_labels, delete_label, update_label, label/unlabel thread/message, search_threads, drafts, etc.). It exposes **no filter APIs** — filters can only be managed through the Gmail settings UI.
  - `search_threads` label queries take label **IDs** (e.g. `label:Label_42`), not display names; get IDs from `list_labels`.
  - `delete_label` is the clean way to remove a label; confirm it is empty first with `search_threads` (`in:anywhere`). The Gmail sidebar may keep rendering a deleted label until the page reloads.
- User labels and Gmail **system categories** can share a name (e.g. a user label named the same as a built-in category like Purchases). Clients such as Shortwave list both in one picker (cart icon = system category, plain tag icon = user label). This project's filters apply user labels only.

## Automating Gmail settings (hard-won)

**Import flow — safe and fully automatable (no native dialogs):**

1. `https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters` → "Import filters" link → upload with `file_upload` on the file input ref (never click "Choose File" — it opens a native picker) → "Open file".
2. In the review list Gmail **unchecks** rows it warns about (label+delete combos). Click the import section's "Select: All" link — the All/None pair immediately preceding the "Create filters" button (there are three All/None pairs on the page).
3. Leave "Apply new filters to existing email" **unchecked** unless retroactive application is explicitly wanted.
4. "Create filters" runs an in-page progress overlay at ~1–2 filters/sec (a ~100-filter import takes a couple of minutes). Filters identical to existing ones are silently skipped (the "Failed or skipped" counter).
5. Re-importing the full file **duplicates** every non-identical-but-overlapping filter — Gmail only dedupes exact matches (criteria and actions). To update existing filters, edit them or delete the old ones first; don't blind re-import.

**Filter EDIT — automatable:** row "edit" link → criteria overlay → Continue → actions screen. The label picker is a div listbox (`role=listbox`/`role=option`), not a `<select>`: open it by clicking the listbox ref, then select by dispatching `mouseover/mousedown/mouseup/click` MouseEvents on the option with the **exact** target text (beware near-identical names), verify the listbox text via DOM read, then "Update filter".

**Filter DELETE — not safely automatable.** The per-row delete links and the bulk Delete button call native `window.confirm()`:

- No automation path can click a native dialog. While one is pending, computer-tool actions (screenshot/click) fail with "Cannot access a chrome-extension:// URL of different extension", while DOM tools (read_page/find/get_page_text/javascript) keep working. Recover by closing the wedged tab and creating a fresh one.
- Overriding `window.confirm` from javascript_tool does **not** work — the tool runs in an isolated world; the page still sees the native function.
- **Danger:** a pending dialog can be auto-*accepted* when its tab is destroyed — a deletion that appeared cancelled can land minutes later. Never leave a delete dialog pending, and recount filters afterward rather than assuming a cancelled delete stayed cancelled.
- Deletions should be done by the user (tick checkboxes → Delete → one OK confirms the whole batch), or with the user present to click OK.

**Gmail settings DOM notes:**

- Old-school HTML in the top document (no iframes). Filter rows are `tr` elements containing "Do this:" plus an edit link; edit/delete controls are `span.sA[role="link"]`. The settings page preloads other tabs' content — label-management rows are also in the DOM, so always constrain row selectors with "Do this:".
- Element refs go stale after any click that re-renders the list. Re-find before each click, one mutation per call, and verify state after — JS DOM reads are the most reliable verification.
- Coordinate clicks are unreliable (viewport vs screenshot scale mismatch). Use refs from find/read_page, or dispatch events from JS.
