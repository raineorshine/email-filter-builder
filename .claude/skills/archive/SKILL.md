# Archive (message → mail like it skips the inbox)

Shorthand for `/filter auto-archive based on sender + subject`. Input is one message: a screenshot,
its sender and subject typed out, or both. Output is a `filters.js` rule that archives mail from
that sender whose subject marks it as the same kind, written and synced by the `filter` skill.

This skill settles what a bare "archive this" leaves open — the action, the scope, the key — so the
usual run asks nothing. Everything else belongs to `filter`: the session-title prefixes, where the
spec lives, the dedupe, the sync and the report.

Examples in this file are invented; the privacy rule in `AGENTS.md` applies to it.

## Procedure

### 1. Hand off to filter

Invoke the `filter` skill (Skill tool) with the args `auto-archive based on sender + subject`,
followed by anything the user typed, and follow it end to end. The steps below amend the `filter`
steps they name; where they are silent, `filter` stands.

### 2. Settle the open choices (filter steps 2–3)

Unless the user's words say otherwise:

- **Archive only.** The mail skips the inbox; no label is added and nothing is trashed.
- **Mail like this one.** "These" means the message's own kind, not everything its sender sends.
- **Sender and subject together**, even when the sender sends nothing else today: the subject keeps
  a later receipt or security alert from the same address in the inbox.

### 3. Find the message's kind (filter steps 1–2)

If the screenshot shows several messages and nothing singles one out — an open message, a selected
row, a typed sender — ask which, with 🚙 set first.

Survey the sender with `search_threads` on `from:<address>` (the domain, when the local part
rotates), `pageSize` 50. The default view carries each message's sender address and subject, so
this needs no `get_message`. Page back until a full page adds no new kind; kinds the sender has stopped sending
do not matter. The message's own kind is the family, and every other kind must keep going where it
goes today — so the fragment follows filter step 2's rule with one more constraint: no other kind
may contain it.

| Family vs. the sender's other kinds                    | Rule                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| A fragment the whole family has and no other kind does | sender + that fragment — the usual case       |
| No such fragment, but a List-Id only the family has    | sender + List-Id                              |
| No such fragment, and the sender sends no other kind   | sender alone — say so in the report           |
| No such fragment, and other kinds exist                | not expressible — say so and ask, with 🚙 set |

A List-Id is a header, and of `get_message`'s formats only `RAW` carries headers. Reuse the `from`
the spec already has for this sender, if it has one (filter step 4's grep finds it), so the
sender's conditions differ only by subject.

### 4. Keep every label (filter step 4)

Archiving adds to what the mail gets today; it never swaps a label out. An entry that already
labels this mail keeps doing so:

- **A broader condition** (`*@acme.com` → Newsletters) stays as it is, and the archive condition
  goes in an archive-only entry. Gmail stacks the two filters, and in Proton a label never
  conflicts with a folder.
- **The same condition** moves to an entry with that label plus `archive` — never to an
  archive-only entry, which would drop the label.

An entry that already archives this mail makes the request a `duplicate`. If the screenshot shows
the message in the inbox anyway, that is the `match` skill's step 4 — mail older than the filter,
an unsynced filter, or a `gmail` NO MATCH — not a reason for a second rule.

### 5. Check the rule against real mail (filter step 5)

After the edit, run the `gmail` term the matcher prints for the new condition through
`search_threads`, back to the oldest date step 3 surveyed (`after:`). Every thread it returns must
be the family; anything else is mail the filter would archive by mistake — lengthen the fragment
and check again before syncing. This is Gmail's own engine on real mail, so it covers what the
survey and the matcher cannot: other addresses a widened `from` reaches, and Gmail's token and
punctuation rules.

### 6. Report (filter step 7)

Add one line naming the sender's other kinds — the mail this rule leaves where it was. The message
itself stays where it is too: the rule is for mail still to come.
